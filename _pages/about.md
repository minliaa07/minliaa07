I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Prior to this, I worked as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Michigan from 2021 to 2023. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Structural Engineering from Colorado State University in 2021. Additionally, I hold a B.Eng. degree in Civil Engineering and an M.S. degree in Structural Engineering from Southeast University in Nanjing, China.

My research group explores the synergy between civil engineering and cutting-edge data-driven methodologies. We strive to understand the resilience and risk associated with complex civil systems, such as buildings, transportation networks, and energy infrastructure, particularly in the face of disruptions like natural hazards. By integrating surrogate modeling, machine learning, and data analytics, we streamline simulations to tackle uncertainties and optimize designs and resource allocation schemes. Our aim is to develop effective and efficient pre-event mitigation and post-event recovery strategies that enable robust decision-making in infrastructure resilience planning amidst uncertainties in order to enhance the resilience and sustainability of the built environment.

Our research interests are centered around several key areas:
-	Risk assessment and mitigation for structures/infrastructure under natural hazards
-	Resilience-based decision-making for critical infrastructure
-	Data-driven condition assessment and optimal maintenance of civil infrastructure
-	Robust analysis and design of wave/wind energy systems
